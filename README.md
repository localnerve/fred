> A data repo that contains content and models for examples

The files represent the output of a more traditional data service and include content and models by resource name.

The resource.json is the main resource of the service. It acts as a manifest that supplies application routes with all other route specific (and application global) resources reachable from it.

Different branches are used for different Environments (as labelled).
