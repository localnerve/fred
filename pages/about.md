## About This Demo

This demo is only meant to be a reference application. It serves as a possible source of inspiration for solving problems during isomorphic application development, or as a basis for a [progressive application](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/).

The outgoing mail queue is currently disconnected from this application on Heroku, so contact form completions will not succeed.

Please visit the project [documentation](https://github.com/localnerve/flux-react-example/wiki) for more detailed info, or contact me @localnerve.
