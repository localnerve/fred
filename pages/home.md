## Welcome To The Demo
This is an isomorphic web app that demonstrates performance techniques and multiple backing services.

### Data Driven Flux & React
All the content you see, including navigation, comes from a [backend data service](https://github.com/localnerve/flux-react-example-data).
This application uses Facebook's [React](http://reactjs.com) and Yahoo's [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io).
